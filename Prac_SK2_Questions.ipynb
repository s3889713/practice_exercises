    "As in the [SK2 Tutorial](https://www.featureranking.com/tutorials/machine-learning-tutorials/sk-part-2-feature-selection-and-ranking/), the goal of this practice notebook is to illustrate how you can perform feature selection (FS) and ranking using the relevant methods within `Scikit-Learn`. You will be using the cleaned \"income data\" from previous data preparation practices you will take a cross-validation (CV) approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous practices, you cleaned and transformed the raw `income data` and renamed the `income` column as `target` (with high income being the positive class). Including `target`, the cleaned data consists of 42 columns and 45,222 rows. Each column is numeric and between 0 and 1.\n",

    "- For ease of computation, you will first randomly sample 5,000 rows from this dataset. \n",
    "- You will then split this sample into two equal-sized datasets.\n",
    "- You will use the first set for **training**: you will find the best 10-features using different methods using this train data. \n",
    "- You will use the second set for **testing**: you will perform cross-validation in a paired fashion using the test data and then you will compare the results using a paired t-test.\n",
