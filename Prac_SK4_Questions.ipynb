We will show two examples of this: one for classification and one for regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use **stratified 5-fold cross-validation with 2 repetitions** during training. For testing, you will use the fine-tuned model for prediction **without** any cross-validation for simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `GridSearchCV()`, try setting `n_jobs` to -2 for shorter run times with parallel processing. Here, -2 means use all core except 1. See [SK5 Tutorial](https://www.featureranking.com/tutorials/machine-learning-tutorials/sk-part-5-advanced-topics-pipelines-statistical-model-comparison-and-model-deployment/) for more details."
