    "As in the [SK0 Tutorial](https://www.featureranking.com/tutorials/machine-learning-tutorials/sk-part-0-introduction-to-machine-learning-with-python-and-scikit-learn/), the objective of this practice notebook is to show you a panoramic view of how to build simple machine learning models using the cleaned \"income data\" from previous data preparation practices using a `holdout` approach. In the previous practices, you cleaned and transformed the raw `income data` and renamed the `income` column as `target` which is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{target} = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{ if the income exceeds USD 50,000} \\\\ 0 & \\text{ otherwise }\\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Including `target`, the cleaned data consists of 42 columns and 45,222 rows. Each column is numeric and between 0 and 1."
